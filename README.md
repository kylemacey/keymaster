# KeyMaster

KeyMaster is a GitHub authentication gateway inspired by [Gatekeeper](https://github.com/prose/gatekeeper) designed specifically for installed applications (such as Chrome Extensions) that do not have a specific URL that can be redirected to in order to provide the temporary code that GitHub returns from its OAuth Endpoint. It is meant to be called with `window.open` and receive messages from [`window.postMessage()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage).
